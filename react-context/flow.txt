For each feature in the application, describe the flow of the code in writing,
including the client, server, and database. How does it work?

User can sign up. (user credentials are stored)
- Credentials are submitted by user
- The client hashes the password
- Client sends a POST request to the server
- Server sends credentials to database
- The database stores the username and hashed password



User can sign in. (user identity is checked through database)
- User inputs credentials
- Client sends GET request for credentials
- Server request stored credentials from database
- Database sends back username and hasedPassword
- Client recieves data and parses the hasedPassword
- Client verifys that credentials match with the user input
- Client request assinged an access token


User can stay signed in. (granted access rights to client applications over HTTP)
- Client verifys credentials
- An acess token is sent with every HTTP server request
